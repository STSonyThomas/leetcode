    # Graph Valid Tree Solution
    
    1. **Approach**  
    * Utilize Kahn's Algorithm to detect cycles and ensure the graph is fully connected.
    * Implement BFS with indegree tracking to process and remove leaf nodes iteratively.
    * Time Complexity: O(n + e)
    * Concepts: Graphs, BFS, Topological Sort, Kahn's Algorithm
