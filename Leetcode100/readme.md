# Same Tree Solution

1. **Approach**  
* Recursively compare nodes of both trees
* Base case: if both nodes are None, return True
* If one node is None and the other is not, return False
* If values of nodes are different, return False
* Recursively check left and right subtrees
* Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree
* Concepts: Recursion, Binary Trees
