# Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph Solution

1. **Approach**  
* Utilize Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph.
* Represent the graph using an adjacency list with a `defaultdict`.
* Use a queue (`deque`) to manage the BFS traversal order.
* Maintain a `visited` list to keep track of visited nodes.
* Increment the connected component count each time a new BFS traversal is initiated from an unvisited node.
* Time Complexity: O(n + e), where n is the number of nodes and e is the number of edges.
* Concepts: Graphs, BFS, Queue, Hashmaps, Adjacency List
