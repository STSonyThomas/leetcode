# Course Schedule Solution

1. **Approach**  
    * Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles  
    * Use an adjacency list to represent course prerequisites  
    * Maintain `visited` and `recursion stack` sets to track traversal  
    * Time Complexity: O(V + E)  
    * Concepts: DFS, Graphs, Topological Sort, Hashmaps
