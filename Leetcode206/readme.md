# Reverse Linked List Solution

1. **Approach**
   * Iterate through the linked list
   * Reverse the links between nodes
   * Keep track of previous, current, and next nodes
   * Time: Measured in driver code (varies based on input size)
   * Concepts: Linked Lists, Iterative Traversal, Pointers

<u>Leetcode Problem Number #206</u>
**STATUS**: _Accepted_

## Implementation Details
* The solution uses an iterative approach to reverse the linked list
* A `ListNode` class is defined to represent each node in the linked list
* The `reverseList` method in the `Solution` class performs the reversal
* Driver code is included to create a sample linked list, reverse it, and measure execution time

## Usage
Run the script to see the original linked list, the reversed linked list, and the execution time:
